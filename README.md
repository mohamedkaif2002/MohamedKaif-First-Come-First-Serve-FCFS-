First Come First Serve (FCFS) Scheduling Algorithm.

ALGORITHM:
1.	Read the number of processes and burst time of each process.
2.	Set the waiting time of the first process as zero.
3.	For other process, the waiting time of the process is compiled as the sum of the waiting time of previous process and the burst time of the previous process.
4.	Draw the Gantt chart and display the sequence in which the process are served in the Gantt chart.
5.	Compute the turnaround time of all process as the sum of the waiting time, of the process and the burst time of the process
6.	Compute the average turnaround time and the average waiting time.
